<p><strong>Batch tasking</strong>: Group similar tasks together to maintain productivity and reduce multitasking, which can be detrimental to quality and efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Take breaks</strong>: Schedule regular breaks throughout the day to rest and recharge, which is essential for maintaining creative stamina.</p>
</li>
