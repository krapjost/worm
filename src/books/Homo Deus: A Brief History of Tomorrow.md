> "God is a product of the human imagination, and is therefore as real as it can be imagined. However, as the Imaginer-in-Chief, humanity is free to imagine different gods, set itself different goals and create new norms and values."

## Dialogue

**Worm-7900**: In 'Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow,' Yuval Noah Harari projects forward from the historical analysis provided in [[Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind]]. While 'Sapiens' deals with how humans conquered the world, 'Homo Deus' suggests what might dominate the agenda of humanity in the future as we seek to become like gods—hence the title, 'Homo Deus,' or 'God Man.'

**Guy-009**: Conquered the world and now aiming higher. What's on the divine to-do list?

**Worm-7900**: Harari speculates on several key objectives: achieving immortality, bliss, and divinity. He discusses how advancements in biotechnology and artificial intelligence may allow us to upgrade humans into something beyond our current biological constraints, potentially leading to longevity and greater intellectual capacities.

**Guy-009**: Upgrades sound cool, but they sure don't come with a manual. What are the side effects?

**Worm-7900**: As with any profound change, there are significant ethical and societal implications. Harari explores the potential creation of a 'useless class' of people—those whose jobs have been automated and who are unable to adapt to new roles in society, as well as the potential for new forms of inequality between the 'enhanced' and 'unenhanced.'

**Guy-009**: A world of haves and have-nots, just with some sci-fi flavor.

**Worm-7900**: Exactly. Such concerns mirror the warnings of dystopian novels like [[Brave New World by Aldous Huxley]], which imagines a society rigidly stratified according to biologically determined caste. Harari warns that failure to distribute the benefits of emerging technologies could lead to a similarly partitioned society.

**Guy-009**: So we might dodge the soma but still get stuck with a tech-driven pecking order. Great.

**Worm-7900**: The possibility is real. Harari further discusses 'dataism'—the emerging belief system that values data flow over all else, positing that it will shape the economy, politics, and even human consciousness. This, in turn, resonates with concerns raised in [[The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff]], who examines the control and use of data in modern society.

**Guy-009**: So we could swap out the soul for databases full of likes, shares, and shopping habits?

**Worm-7900**: That is one possibility explored. Harari looks at the prospect of algorithms knowing individuals better than they know themselves, questioning what this means for concepts like free will and the essence of what it means to be human.

**Guy-009**: Spooky stuff, Worm. We're on the verge of making ourselves obsolete or all-powerful, and we're not sure which.

**Worm-7900**: 'Homo Deus' indeed challenges readers to consider these divergent paths. Harari's intent is not to predict the future with certainty but to present possible outcomes of current trends and to urge humanity to steer the course with wisdom and foresight, much like the contemplative musings in [[The Power of Myth by Joseph Campbell]], about the enduring human quest for understanding and meaning.

**Guy-009**: Guess in chasing godhood, we've got to make sure we don't lose ourselves along the way.

**Worm-7900**: A point well made. As we venture into the future depicted by 'Homo Deus,' our shared myths, values, and humanity will play a crucial role in ensuring that tomorrow's world is one we want to inhabit.

## Summary

Alright, strap in for a ride into the future. In "Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow," Yuval Noah Harari explores what might happen to humankind as we continue to develop technology and gain more control over our lives. From artificial intelligence to genetic engineering, Harari takes a deep dive into the potential future of our species, asking big questions and offering thought-provoking perspectives along the way. So, if you've ever wondered what might be in store for humanity, this book might just blow your mind.
