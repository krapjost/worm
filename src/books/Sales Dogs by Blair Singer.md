"I have found that sales success is 80 percent mental and emotional and only 20 percent mechanical. Your ability to understand and actualize your attitude, emotional wit, and style as a sales dog is what will most directly impact your sales success."

## Dialogue
**Worm-7900**: 'Sales Dogs: You Do Not Have to Be an Attack Dog to Be Successful in Sales' by Blair Singer is a book that uses the metaphor of different breeds of dogs to describe various sales techniques and personalities. Rather than champion a one-size-fits-all approach to sales, Singer argues that understanding one's unique sales personality is key to maximizing effectiveness.

**Guy-009**: A sales book with dogs, now that's a fun twist. What kind of breeds is he talking about, and how do they fit into sales?

**Worm-7900**: Blair Singer identifies five primary ‘breeds’ of Sales Dogs:

1. **Pit Bull**: Aggressive and tenacious, this seller won't let go until the deal is done. They are confident and forceful, willing to push hard to close the sale.

2. **Golden Retriever**: Friendly and service-oriented, these salespeople rely on building strong relationships and are great at maintaining long-term client loyalty.

3. **Chihuahua**: Knowledgeable about the technical details of their product or service, these sellers can talk at length about specifics and can be quite convincing due to their expertise.

4. **Poodle**: Elegant and sophisticated, they know the right people and move in the right circles. They are effective in high-end sales environments.

5. **Basset Hound**: They may appear slow and laid back, but they have excellent instincts and can spot an opportunity a mile away.

**Guy-009**: Neat lineup. So, does Singer think people should change their style or just get better at what comes naturally?

**Worm-7900**: Singer suggests that embracing one’s natural style is crucial. By understanding their inherent selling style, individuals can sharpen their skills within that style, rather than trying to be something they’re not. However, he also points out the value of learning from other styles to become a more well-rounded seller.

**Guy-009**: Makes sense. Play to your strengths, but don't get stuck in a rut. Do you think Mamet's characters from [[Glengarry Glen Ross by David Mamet]] could benefit from reading this?

**Worm-7900**: It's an interesting thought, Guy. The desperate salesmen in Mamet's play could indeed have benefited from such insights, possibly avoiding their ethical pitfalls by embracing a sales approach more aligned with their personalities rather than succumbing to the pressure to engage in unethical behaviors.

**Guy-009**: Finding the right way to sell without losing your soul sounds like a winning strategy in any book.

**Worm-7900**: Definitely, Guy. 'Sales Dogs' puts forth the idea that success in sales, much like success in any field, is about leveraging personal strengths and developing versatility. It is a concept that is readily applicable in other areas beyond sales, emphasizing personal awareness and growth.

**Guy-009**: Good deal. I’ll stick to being myself—seems like that's a pretty good breed to be.

**Worm-7900**: An excellent choice, indeed. Authenticity is often the most compelling salesman of all. Blair Singer's work encourages us all to value our individual traits and to develop our innate capabilities to their full potential.
