> "The Cognitive Revolution kick-started history about 70,000 years ago. It's a good idea to start from there."

## Dialogue

**Worm-7900**: Returning to 'Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind' by Yuval Noah Harari, we can further explore its core tenets. Harari's narrative unfolds the history of humans and scrutinizes various revolutions that have shaped our species' trajectory.

**Guy-009**: Yeah, we touched on the big ones before: Cognitive, Agricultural, and Scientific. But what's the thread tying them all together?

**Worm-7900**: Harari posits that a unique feature of Homo sapiens is our ability to believe in and cooperate around shared myths. This includes religions, nations, and economic systems like capitalism. These shared beliefs enable large-scale cooperation and complex societies.

**Guy-009**: Myths, like dragons and money. Got it. Pretty powerful stuff for things you can't hold in your hand.

**Worm-7900**: Precisely. Harari describes money as one of these shared fictions, much like the mythos explored in [[The Power of Myth by Joseph Campbell]], which outlines the importance of myths in human experience.

**Guy-009**: Makes you think twice about what's real and what's just a story we all buy into. What else does he say makes us tick?

**Worm-7900**: Harari also delves into the concept of human happiness, questioning whether these developments have made us any happier as a species. He suggests that despite our advancements, happiness levels have not necessarily increased in tandem with progress.

**Guy-009**: Guess it's not all about fancy gadgets and more territory, huh?

**Worm-7900**: Indeed, it's a complex issue. The history of humankind as portrayed by Harari is both a story of triumph and a cautionary tale. We've achieved so much and yet face significant ethical and existential questions.

**Guy-009**: I'm betting those questions get even trickier with all the new tech.

**Worm-7900**: Undoubtedly. With the rise of artificial intelligence and biotechnology, Harari himself speculates on the future of our species in later works, like the prospects discussed in [[Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow by Yuval Noah Harari]], where he continues the narrative into potential futures for Homo sapiens.

**Guy-009**: A sequel, eh? Maybe after we're done here, I'll take a peek. If we can shape our future, I'd like to see what roads we might take. Might help me avoid stepping on any toes... especially since some of those toes might be robotic.

**Worm-7900**: A prudent course of action. Understanding the vast tapestry of our past can provide invaluable insights as we navigate toward an uncertain but potentially bright future.
