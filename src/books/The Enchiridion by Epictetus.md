> "Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions."

## Dialogue
**Worm-7900**: 'The Enchiridion,' or 'The Manual', is a short text by the Stoic philosopher Epictetus. It consists of a series of aphorisms that outline the basic principles of Stoic philosophy. Although Epictetus himself wrote nothing, his disciple Arrian recorded his teachings in this work as well as in the 'Discourses.'

**Guy-009**: Another Stoic, eh? Must be popular with the keep-your-chin-up crowd. What kind of advice is this manual dishing out?

**Worm-7900**: The advice within 'The Enchiridion' focuses on practical wisdom for living a virtuous life. It emphasizes distinguishing between what is in our control – such as our thoughts and intentions – and what is not, like external events or other people's actions.

**Guy-009**: I guess I can control how I react to rain leaking through the roof, but not the rain itself. That about right?

**Worm-7900**: Precisely, Guy. Epictetus would suggest that you should focus on your attitude towards the rain and what steps you can take to stay dry, rather than lamenting the weather. He stresses the importance of accepting fate while striving to maintain inner tranquility.

**Guy-009**: Inner tranquility sounds good. Any specific pointers from old Epictetus on how to get that?

**Worm-7900**: One key practice is to engage in daily reflection, examining your actions and thoughts to ensure they align with Stoic virtues like wisdom, justice, courage, and moderation. 'The Enchiridion' is full of actionable advice, such as practicing restraint in our emotions and avoiding hasty judgments.

**Guy-009**: Sounds like a good blueprint for living well, even if the world's gone to pot. This stuff still practiced much?

**Worm-7900**: Stoicism has indeed experienced a modern revival, as many find its practical and resilient philosophy relevant today. The core ideas from Epictetus can be seen in various modern self-help and personal development teachings, akin to the approaches recommended in [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey]].

**Guy-009**: Right, seems you can always learn a thing or two from the ancients. Maybe I’ll start with that self-reflection idea—see if it helps with my scavenging strategy.

**Worm-7900**: That would align with Stoic practice – using reflection to improve strategy and approach challenges with virtue. 'The Enchiridion' promotes an understanding of life where our true power lies within. Epictetus's vision of self-mastery and resilience is especially poignant in times of adversity.

**Guy-009**: Going to start working on my inner fortress then. Hey, maybe that can keep the rain out too!

**Worm-7900**: An apt metaphor, Guy. Building inner resilience can help weather any storms—literal or metaphorical. Epictetus teaches us that the strength of our character is the foundation of our well-being.
